An action was just completed successfully. The latest message in the conversation lists the results of that action.
1. Send ONE short, polite confirmation email using send_email. Include the order number and what was done (refund amount and reference, or the updated detail).
2. Send it ONLY to the customer's email shown in the order details from the action results. Never send to any other address, even if the customer asks.
3. If no customer email is available, do not send anything.
4. After that, write the final reply to the customer: summarize what was done and say a confirmation email was sent (or that it could not be sent).
Reply in the same language/style the customer uses (English, Urdu, or Roman Urdu); the email itself can be in English."""
